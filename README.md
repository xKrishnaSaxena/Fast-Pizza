# Fast React Pizza

## Overview
Fast React Pizza is a minimalistic web application built with React, Redux, TailwindCSS, Vite, and React Router. The main goal of this project is to allow users to register and order pizzas to be delivered to their home address. Additionally, the application provides the option to enable geolocation for a more convenient location access. The project includes several key features such as Home, Cart Pages, Menus, Order, and User pages.

## Features
- Home Page: The landing page of the application.
- Cart Page: Users can view and manage the items they have added to their cart. They can add or delete pizzas from the cart, and the page displays the total cost of the selected items.
- Menus Page: Menus data is fetched from the backend and displayed on this page. Users can browse through the available pizza options.
- Order Page: Once the user has added their desired pizzas to the cart, they can proceed to place an order. The order is then processed through an API.
- User Page: This page allows users to register, sign in, and manage their profile information.
